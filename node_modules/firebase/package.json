  "readme": "# Firebase\n\n## Overview\n\n[Firebase](https://www.firebase.com/) provides three key services that enable you to build rich, full-featured applications using just client-side code:\n\n0. **A realtime data API.** Our API replaces the need for most backend databases and server code by handling the heavy lifting of data storage and synchronization.\n\n0. **User management and authentication.** Our Simple Login service handles your user management and authentication needs out-of-the-box. Or, if you prefer to manage users yourself, you can maintain complete control using Custom Login.\n\n0. **Hosting.** With hosting, you can deploy your static website to the internet with a single command.\n\nAll of these services are built for security, reliability, and scale, so you can deploy your applications with confidence.\n\n## Node.js & Firebase\n\nWhile you can write entire Firebase applications without any backend code, many developers will still want to run their own servers. For these developers, we provide a full-featured Node.js module. This library has the same Javascript API and features as our web client.\n\nTo get started, install Firebase from npm:\n\n    npm install firebase\n\nNow, just require the library in your application and start using your data:\n\n    var Firebase = require('firebase');\n    var myRootRef = new Firebase('https://myprojectname.firebaseIO-demo.com/');\n    myRootRef.set(\"hello world!\");\n\n## Next Steps\n\nIf you haven't already done so, you should try our [tutorial](https://www.firebase.com/tutorial/index.html#gettingstarted). Next, we recommend checking out our [example apps](https://www.firebase.com/docs/examples.html) or reading on in the [docs](https://www.firebase.com/docs/).\n\n\n\n",
